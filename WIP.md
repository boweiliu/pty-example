### migrating to vite
why: it has better typescript + rollup defaults

how:
- [x] set up vite + typescript (no react)
- [x] hook up vite to xterm (npm install, etc.)
- [x] hook up vite to express
- [x] copy over the express websocket code
- [x] test the backend websocket alone
- [ ] hook up xterm client to websocket
- [ ] Delete extraneous vite code
- [ ] Test end2end with a progress bar script
- [ ] Test end2end with tmux/vim

Now should have parity with the other example.
